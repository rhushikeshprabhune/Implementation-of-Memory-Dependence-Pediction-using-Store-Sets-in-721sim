# Implementation-of-Memory-Dependence-Pediction-using-Store-Sets-in-721sim
1.Implemented a memory dependence prediction algorithm using store sets mechanism to improve the performance of a RISC-V superscalar processor in 721sim (cycle-accurate RISC-V superscalar simulator).

2.Compared the performance improvement of the store set implementation over simple sticky bit memory dependence prediction, oracle disambiguation, blind speculation, and no speculation.
